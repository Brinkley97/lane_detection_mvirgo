 Personal Project : Implement [Michael Virgo MLND](https://towardsdatascience.com/lane-detection-with-deep-learning-part-1-9e096f3320b7)
 - Main : draw_detected_lanes.py
 - Takes in a road image, re-sizes for the model, predicts the lane to be drawn from the model in G color, recreates an RGB image of a lane and merges with the original road image.
